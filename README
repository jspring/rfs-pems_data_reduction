The two scripts "recipe_for_getting_and_reducing_30_sec_data.sh" and 
"select_station_data_files.sh" are to be used together for reducing 
PeMS 30 second raw data to a set of files containing timestamp, flow, occupancy,
and speed data.

Each data file is named with the station number and date in the convention 
IIIIIII_MM_DD_YYYY.txt, where IIIIIII = station ID, MM=month, SS=day, and 
YYYY=year.
The format of each line in the data file is:
Timestamp Lane1_flow Lane1_occ Lane1_speed Lane2_flow Lane2_occ Lane2_speed Lane3_flow Lane3_occ Lane3_speed Lane4_flow Lane4_occ Lane4_speed Lane5_flow Lane5_occ Lane5_speed Lane6_flow Lane6_occ Lane6_speed Lane7_flow Lane7_occ Lane7_speed Lane8_flow Lane8_occ Lane8_speed

Each metadata file is named with the convention IIIIIII_info.txt. Its format,
on separate lines, is:

Station number
Freeway
Direction
CA Postmile
Absolute Postmile
Latitude
Longitude
Length
Lane type 
Number of lanes
Name of street/intersection
Format of data files (see above)

Raw 30 second PeMS data, containing all of the station data within a Caltrans
district, is archived daily in a single tarball, and it is huge.
So these scripts were written to allow us to pick a freeway, direction, and
start and stop absolute postmiles to reduce the set of files produced to 
something more manageable.

"recipe_for_getting_and_reducing_30_sec_data.sh" is run first.  Its arguments
are "metadata file", "data file", "freeway", "direction", 
"start absolute postmile", and "stop_absolute_postmile".  This script produces
separate data and metadata files for ALL stations in a Caltrans district, from
the original tarfile.  This was done because the processing time for filtering
the copy process by freeway, direction, etc. would be inordinately long.  So
all stations have separate data and metadata files.

"select_station_data_files.sh" is run on the resultant directory of data files.
This script uses the metadata file produced by 
"recipe_for_getting_and_reducing_30_sec_data.sh" to save only the data files
needed by the selections given to it.

Everything is saved to a data directory, named with the convention 
ddd_MM_DD_YYYY, where ddd=Caltrans district, MM=month, DD=day, and YYYY=year.
An example would be "d10_05_12_2014".
